A react application which, through hooks and api's, is in charge of searching for gifts and then it renders them on the web with a maximum quantity of 10. This project was one of the first that I did in which it started in 2021, When I was just starting to learn React.

It doesn't have a very complicated design, but it's more about functionality and the fact that it's using an api to get the gifts.
