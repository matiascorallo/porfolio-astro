## E-commerce

>Designed and created with the functionality of being a sales site.

It is a site as mentioned before made with react, bootstrap, axios, redux, stripe (payment method) and socket io. Obviously all these languages, frameworks and technologies are implemented on the web and working. 

The page has the possibility of creating an account (for the client), logging in and out, the ability to see the products and buy them from the web where obviously the address of the person and the payment method to make the purchase are entered. It also has the function of being able to see all the orders that were made by it. In the same part of orders they appear if they were sent or are pending. When these go from pending to sent, a notification is sent to the client. The same happens for the admin, a notification appears in case an order is created

### Product admin functions

On the part of the admin, it has the possibility of creating products by adding a title, description, price and an image which can be uploaded from local files, links and other means from the same e-commerce. The admin can also see all the products from a dashboard in which he has the option to delete or edit them.

### Other admin functions

The admin in the subject of the orders can see all of all the users, the products they carry and the final price of these. 

Finally, something that everyone can see is that when someone enters the preview of a product, similar products appear, which are filtered by their category, and there is also the option of being able to buy more of the same product.
