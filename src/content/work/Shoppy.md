Shoppy is an administration panel designed to simplify the management of an online store. Its objective is to provide store administrators with a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface for managing orders and products.

One of Shoppy's most important features is order management, which allows store administrators to track orders, update their status, and generate invoices and shipping labels. Additionally, the administration panel provides an overview of sales and important statistics to help administrators make informed decisions.
